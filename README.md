## ❓ FAQ

### ❗ Why does Windows say the app might be dangerous?

Stosufy isn't digitally signed (no license), so Windows treats it as "unknown software."
There is **no malware** - it's safe to use.

### 🔄 What if something doesn't load?

Sometimes authentication can fail (still a work-in-progress).
Use the **"Refresh Auth"** button in the app to manually reset authentication.
This usually solves the problem:
